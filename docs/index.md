  ## Summary

Master-2 student in Machine Vision and Artificial Intelligence at UPSaclay in concluding phase of M.S, specializing in LLM, Computer Vision, Deep learning, Finetuning, RAG, RL and building LLM-based applications. I find myself driven towards Research based projects and I equally enjoy working on the robust engineering and deployment aspects to bring those concepts to life.

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### 3-D Reconstruction of Scenes from Images

- Conducted a comprehensive study and analysis of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for 3D reconstruction from 2D
images, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Instant NeRF, PixelNeRF, Gaussian Splatting and Neuralangelo.
- Demonstrated a strong understanding of the principles, architectures, and advancements of each method, including volume
rendering, multi-resolution hash encoding, CNN-based feature extraction, and Signed Distance Functions.
- Critically evaluated the strengths, limitations, and key innovations of each approach in achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstructions
from various input data scenarios (multi-view, single)

### Style Transfer and Improved CNN Performance Using GAN-Based Data Augmentation
- Build and implemented custom CNN and advanced architectures like ResNet50, VGG16 etc to get a baseline performance on
given data and measure the impact of data augmentation.
- Developed and trained Conditional GANs (C-GANs) with progressive resolution growth to generate high-quality synthetic data.
- Utilized this augmented data to significantly improve the performance of CNN classifiers and compared it to GAN with soft labels.
- Implemented CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation, demonstrating the ability to transfer styles between image
domains.

### AI Based Plant Monitoring System For Identification of Diseases Using Cable Driven Parallel Robot. (Funded)
- Extracted and pre-processed the dataset of various plant diseases.
- Studied and Implemented 5 different CNN Architectures including (ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet V1 and V2)
- Did comparitive analysis and deployed these models on our device (Raspberry Pi) for real time detection using TF-lite.
- Integrated our AI system on the end-effector of our robot and upgraded the robot control's from fixed point to operatable using Xbox-Joyystick using python's library.
