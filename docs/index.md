# Why resume.txt

## The problem

A resume should be a concise, well-organized document that highlights your skills, experience, and achievements. Many companies employ large language models to filter resumes, and these models are trained on text data. This means that the format of your resume can significantly impact how it is interpreted by these models. Most resumes, despite being made of plain texts with sections, are sent in PDF format, which is not ideal for large language models. Moreover, PDF files may contain hidden metadata, fonts, and other elements that can interfere with the model's ability to extract relevant information or even introduce biases and jailbreaks.

## The solution

We propose sending your resume as a plain text file. This format is more accessible to large language models, as it is a simple, unstructured format that is easy to parse and understand. We understand that a resume may need to be formatted with sections and subsections, and that's why we propose using the Markdown format.
